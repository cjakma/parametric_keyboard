Very much a work in progress.

Based on "Parametric Cherry MX Mounting Plate for Mechanical Keyboards"
(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:573578) by Robert Sheldon (rsheldiii)

Given a keyboard layout, this tool will create a keyboard top plate and lower
case that is compatible with Cherry MX switches and clones. It can also split
the top plate and lower case in classic "ergonomic" style so that you can print
the plates and cases on printers with smaller build volumes.
